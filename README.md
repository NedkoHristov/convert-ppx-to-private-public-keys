# convert-ppx-to-private-public-keys

A small bash script that takes .ppx files and convert it to a private and public certificate.

The script checks if the PuTTYgen package is installed. [PuTTYgen documentation can be found here](https://www.puttygen.com/), but for a fast reference here's how to install it on various OS:

Debian:
```
sudo apt install putty-tools
```

Mac:
```
sudo brew install putty
```

Windows:
```
Don't be surprised, you have to install them on the old-fashioned way - https://www.puttygen.com/#Download_PuTTYgen_on_Windows
